# Clojure Training

This repository is created as part of my journey in learning Clojure programming using the book "Getting Clojure".

## Getting Clojure by Russ Olsen

Getting Clojure is an introductory book to Clojure that thoroughly explains the language fundamentals along with Clojure's unique approach to concurrency and state management.

## Structure of the Repository

This repository is structured according to the chapters in the book. Each namespace corresponds to a chapter in the book.

## Tools Used

The primary tools I used for this project are:

1. IntelliJ IDEA
2. Cursive Plugin
3. Clojure REPL
