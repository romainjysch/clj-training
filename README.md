# Clojure Training

This repository is created as part of my journey into learning Clojure. The goal of this project is to document my learning path and to keep track of my progress.

## Learning Approach

For this learning endeavor, I'm combining three main approaches:

1. Reading books (especially "Getting Clojure" by Russ Olsen);

2. Working on practical online exercises (Exercism platform or yearly Advent of Code).

3. Handling tests with different libraries.

## Tools Used

The primary tools I am using for this project are:

1. IntelliJ IDEA
2. Cursive Plugin
3. Clojure REPL
