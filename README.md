# Clojure Training

This repository is created as part of my journey into learning Clojure. The goal of this project is to document my learning path and to keep track of my progress.

## Learning Approach

For this learning endeavor, I'm combining three main approaches:

1. Reading the book "Getting Clojure" by Russ Olsen.

2. Working on practical online exercises from the [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure) platform.

3. Handling tests with different libraries.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main packages, reflecting the three components of my learning journey:

1. The `exercism` package contains all exercises from the Exercism platform.

2. The `getting_clojure` package is tied to the chapters of the "Getting Clojure" book. It includes various tests I have conducted for each chapter of the book.

3. The `libraries` package contains the different tests associated with various libraries (for example, next.jdbc).

## Tools Used

The primary tools I am using for this project are:

1. IntelliJ IDEA
2. Cursive Plugin
3. Clojure REPL
