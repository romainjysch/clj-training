# Clojure Training

This repository is created as part of my journey into learning Clojure. The goal of this project is to document my learning path while deepening my understanding of the language.

## Learning Approach

For this learning endeavor, I am combining two main approaches:

1. Reading the book "Getting Clojure" by Russ Olsen.

2. Working on practical online exercises from the [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure) platform. These exercises allow me to directly apply the concepts learned.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main packages, reflecting the two components of my learning journey:

1. The exercism package contains all exercises from the Exercism platform.

2. The getting_clojure package is tied to the chapters of the "Getting Clojure" book. It includes various tests I have conducted for each chapter, allowing me to solidify the acquired knowledge.

## Tools Used

The primary tools I am using for this project are:

1. IntelliJ IDEA
2. Cursive Plugin
3. Clojure REPL
